This is an analysis of Aayush Mishra's FIFA 21 Complete Player Dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aayushmishra1512/fifa-2021-complete-player-data/data), where I delve into and analyse the relationship between a player's rating, age, nationality, postion, and their potential rating. For this analysis, I dropped the 'player_id' and 'hits' column, the former as it is just an indentifier for a certain player, which is irrelevant when their name is already given and is more useful and recognisable, and the latter simply because I was not aware of what that column was exactly a measure of.
